# Customer Acquisition Optimization Project

## Project Overview

This project is a data-driven exploration of customer acquisition optimization, conducted in collaboration with Arvato, a global services company. The primary objective was to refine the customer acquisition strategies of a mail-order company by leveraging rich demographic data. We utilized advanced data science techniques, including unsupervised and supervised learning, to uncover insights and develop predictive models.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Exploration:** We delved into Arvato's extensive dataset, which encompassed demographic information for individuals.

- **Unsupervised Learning:** Leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means clustering, we segmented customers based on their characteristics.

- **Supervised Learning:** We trained and fine-tuned machine learning models to predict an individual's likelihood of becoming a new customer.

- **Evaluation Metrics:** Given the data's imbalance, we used the area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) as our primary evaluation metric.

- **Data Insights:** We uncovered meaningful customer clusters and their unique characteristics, providing a basis for tailored marketing and product strategies.

- **Predictive Modeling:** Our models demonstrated strong predictive performance, with LightGBM emerging as the preferred choice.

## Technical Details

- The project utilized Python for data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling.

- Key libraries and tools used include pandas, scikit-learn, LightGBM, and more.
